	<h4>Activities & Assessments</h4>

<ul>
    <li><strong>IT Infrastructure Audit</strong> &rarr; Review cloud adoption, system integration, scalability, and redundancy.</li>
    <li><strong>Disaster Recovery &amp; Business Continuity Testing</strong> &rarr; Conduct tabletop exercises, failover simulations, and recovery time objective (RTO) assessments.</li>
    <li><strong>Cybersecurity Posture Evaluation</strong> &rarr; Perform vulnerability scans, penetration testing, and compliance checks (ISO 27001, NIST, GDPR).</li>
    <li><strong>Data Management &amp; Governance Review</strong> &rarr; Assess data quality, accessibility, and protection policies.</li>
    <li><strong>Operational Resilience Benchmarking</strong> &rarr; Compare incident response readiness and downtime tolerance against industry standards.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Executive Summary</h4>
<p>These targeted activities deliver clear, measurable benefits. They reduce operational risk and downtime by identifying vulnerabilities and validating recovery capabilities; improve compliance and data protection through structured assessments; and optimize costs and performance by revealing inefficiencies and guiding infrastructure and cloud strategies. Practiced recovery exercises and benchmarks strengthen incident response and shorten recovery times. Together they provide leaders with prioritized, evidence-based recommendations to build scalable, secure, and resilient technology and processes that support continuity and strategic growth.</p>
