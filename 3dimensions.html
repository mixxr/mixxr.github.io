				<p>The Digital Posture refers to the overall readiness, maturity, and resilience of an organization’s digital capabilities. Think of it as the organization’s “stance” in the digital economy—how well it can leverage technology to achieve strategic goals, adapt to disruption, and remain competitive.</p>
				<p>The Digital Posture can be analyzed under 3 key Dimensions:</p>

				<p>Cybersecurity sits at the heart of digital posture—it’s not just technical, but cultural and strategic. It builds trust with customers, ensures compliance with regulations like GDPR and HIPAA, and demands proactive defense from design to deployment. When embedded across people, systems, and reputation, it becomes a catalyst for resilience, not just protection.</p>
				<p>By structuring assessments into these three dimensions, organizations can balance people readiness, technical resilience, and external digital reputation—a holistic view of their digital posture.</p>
