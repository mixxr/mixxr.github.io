	<h3>Empowering SMEs to Thrive in the Digital Economy</h3>
	<p>At Digital Posture, we are a network of seasoned fractional C-level advisors dedicated to helping small and
		medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) define, assess, and strengthen their digital posture — the strategic alignment
		of technology, processes, and governance with business growth objectives.
		In today’s software-driven world, every company is a digital company. Yet many SMEs struggle to keep pace with
		evolving technologies, rising customer expectations, and increasingly complex regulations. That’s where we come
		in.</p>
	<p>Our approach is anchored in the 3 Key Dimensions of Digital Posture — a holistic framework that balances:
	<ul>
		<li>People Readiness: Culture, leadership, and digital skills</li>
		<li> Technical Resilience: Infrastructure, cybersecurity, and data management
		</li>
		<li>
			External Reputation: Trust, compliance, and digital visibility
		</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>We work with forward-thinking SME leaders — CTOs, CIOs, CEOs, and business owners — who recognize that digital excellence is a strategic imperative.</p>
