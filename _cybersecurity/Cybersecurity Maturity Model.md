## Digital Culture & Skills (Awareness, behavior, training)

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1 – Initial** | No formal cybersecurity awareness program; employees largely unaware of risks. |
| **2 – Basic** | Occasional awareness campaigns or ad-hoc training; limited participation. |
| **3 – Defined** | Regular training programs (e.g., annual phishing simulations); policies communicated. |
| **4 – Managed** | Continuous awareness initiatives; metrics tracked (e.g., phishing click rates). |
| **5 – Optimized** | Cybersecurity culture embedded; employees act as “human firewalls” with proactive reporting and peer reinforcement. |

## Digital Infrastructure & Processes (Technical defenses, resilience, recovery)

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1 – Initial** | Minimal security controls; no formal disaster recovery or incident response plan. |
| **2 – Basic** | Basic firewalls/antivirus; some backup processes but untested. |
| **3 – Defined** | Documented cybersecurity policies; disaster recovery plan exists and tested occasionally. |
| **4 – Managed** | Advanced controls (IDS/IPS, SIEM, MFA); regular penetration testing; DR/BCP tested annually. |
| **5 – Optimized** | Fully integrated security architecture; automated monitoring and response; disaster recovery drills conducted frequently with near-zero downtime. |

## Digital Presence & Support (Customer-facing trust, transparency, secure interactions)

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1 – Initial** | Weak or absent security signals on websites/apps; no clear privacy policy. |
| **2 – Basic** | Basic SSL certificates; minimal customer communication on security. |
| **3 – Defined** | Secure websites/apps (HTTPS, OWASP compliance); privacy policies published. |
| **4 – Managed** | Proactive monitoring of digital channels; transparent breach communication; customer support trained in security. |
| **5 – Optimized** | Security is a brand differentiator; visible trust signals (certifications, trust badges); customer support seamlessly integrates security guidance. |

##   How to Use the Model
Step 1: Score each dimension from 1–5 based on current practices.

Step 2: Identify gaps (e.g., Culture = 2, Infrastructure = 4, Presence = 3).

Step 3: Prioritize improvements where scores are lowest or risks are highest.

Step 4: Reassess periodically (e.g., annually) to track progress.
