	<h3>What is Digital Posture?</h3>
	<p>Digital posture refers to the overall readiness, maturity, and resilience of an organization’s
		digital capabilities. Think of it as the organization’s “stance” in the digital economy—how well it
		can leverage technology to achieve strategic goals, adapt to disruption, and remain competitive.</p>

	<h3>Why should I care?</h3>
	<p>It's not just about cybersecurity or obtaining certifications like ISO or DORA — it's about the organization's
		image and reputation.
		Digital posture reflects how a company presents itself online, manages information, ensures service
		availability, and interacts with clients and partners.
		It shapes brand perception, operational resilience, and the ability to grow sustainably.
		Ignoring it means overlooking a fundamental pillar of modern competitiveness.</p>

	<h3>How to assess</h3>
	<p>The best way to assess your Digital Posture is through a structured maturity model assessment that
		gives you a holistic view of where your organization stands. A maturity model provides a framework
		to evaluate how advanced your organization is across critical dimensions—strategy, processes,
		technologies, governance, and culture.</p>
