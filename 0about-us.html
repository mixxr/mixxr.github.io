	<h3>Supporting SMEs in scaling strategically within the digital economy.</h3>
	<p>At Digital Posture, we are a network of Fractional Digital Officers dedicated to helping small and
		medium-sized enterprises define, assess, and strengthen their digital posture — the strategic alignment
		of technology, processes, and governance with business growth objectives.
		In today’s software-driven world, every company is a digital company. Yet many SMEs struggle to keep pace with
		evolving technologies, rising customer expectations, and increasingly complex regulations. That’s where we come
		in.</p>
	<p>Our approach is anchored in the <a href="{{ site.lang }}{% link 3dimensions.html%}">3 Key Dimensions of Digital Posture</a> — a holistic framework that balances 
		<b>People Readiness</b>, <b>Technical Resilience</b>, and <b>External Reputation</b>.
	</p>
	<p>We work with CTOs, CIOs, CEOs, and business owners who recognize that digital excellence is a strategic imperative.</p>
